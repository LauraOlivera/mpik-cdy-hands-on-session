By Quentin Remy, (some adapted from Gammapy documentation tutorials)

You should use the Gammapy documentation for help https://docs.gammapy.org/1.2/index.html

## Notebook 1
How to do 1-D Data reduction of public H.E.S.S. data

## Notebook 2
How to model and fit the data produced in notebook 1

## Notebook 3
Data reduction of all the public Crab datasets

## Notebook 4: EXERCISE
Repeat the fitting you did in notebook 2, but this time for the joint Crab datasets

## Notebook 5: 
### EXERCISE 1
Repeat the data reduction, but this time for a 3D dataset of the Galactic Center
### EXERCISE 2
Model the region using a diffuse template and catalog sources

## Notebook 6: EXERCISE
Construct a template model using a GAMERA physical model

## Notebook 7: EXERCISE
Repeat the exercise of notebook 4 but using this physical model
lve an E^-2 injected electron spectrum in the 1 muG magnetic field and CMB. How does the spectrum change over time? How does this relate to the cooling times from above?
