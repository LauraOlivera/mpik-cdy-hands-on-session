# GAMERA exercises
By Davide Depaoli and Georg Schwefer

You should use the GAMERA tutorials for help http://libgamera.github.io/GAMERA/docs/tutorials_main.html

## Exercise 1
Guided exploration of basic features, we will do this one together

## Exercise 2
2a. Assuming the CMB as the target radiation field and a powerlaw electron spectrum with index -2, at what energy does the Klein-Nishina effect show up? What are the spectral indices in both the Thomson and Klein-Nishina limits? How does this depend on electron spectral index? How does it change for a "hotter" CMB?

2b. For a powerlaw electron spectrum, how does the synchrotron spectrum relate to the electron spectrum? What happens when you change the magnetic field?

## Exercise 3
3a. You have electrons with energies between 1 and 100 TeV. Assuming a 1 mG magnetic field and the CMB, in what energy range do these electrons dominate the synchrotron and IC emission, respectively?

3b. What about protons in this energy range?

## Exercise 4
4a. Given a magnetic field of 1 muG and the CMB, what loss process dominates for electrons as a function of energy? How do the loss times scale with energy?  How does this change if the magnetic field and CMB temperature change?

4b. Now evolve an E^-2 injected electron spectrum in the 1 muG magnetic field and CMB. How does the spectrum change over time? How does this relate to the cooling times from above?
