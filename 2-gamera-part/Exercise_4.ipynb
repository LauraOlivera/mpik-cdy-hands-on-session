    "For these parameters, Inverse Compton losses dominate over synchrotron losses for energies below a couple of 100 TeVs. Above that, the Klein-Nishina suppression sets in and synchrotron losses dominate. For synchrotron losses and IC losses in the Thomson regime, energy losses are proportional to E^2, so the loss time goes as E^-1. In the KN limit, the energy loss is almost independent of electron energy, so, so the loss time increases proportional to E. For more details, see Blumenthal and Gould 1970 "
